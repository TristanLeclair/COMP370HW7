# COMP 370 Homework 7 - Web Scraping

It scrapes the top trending articles from the front page of the [Montreal Gazette](https://montrealgazette.com/category/news/) and sends them to a json file

## TODO

- Containerize

## Pitfalls

# Setup/Installation

## Python

`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Running

`python -m scripts.python.collect_trending -h` from info on the tool

`python -m scripts.python.collect_trending -o trending.json` to run and send to `trending.json`
